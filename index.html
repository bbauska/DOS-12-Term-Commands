# DOS 12 Term Commands
12 disk operaing system terminal commands we should all know.

**12 Terminal Commands Every Web Developer Should Know About**

[**Curl**](https://curl.haxx.se/)

Curl is a command line tool for making requests over HTTP(s), FTP and
dozens of other protocols you may have not heard about. It can download
files, check response headers, and freely access remote data.

In web development curl is often used for testing connections and
working with RESTful APIs.
```
# Fetch the headers of a URL.
curl -I http://google.com
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
```
Cache-Control: private

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

Location: http://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=0fCKWe6HCZTd8AfCoIWYBQ

Content-Length: 258

Date: Wed, 09 Aug 2017 11:24:01 GMT
```
# Make a GET request to a remote API.
curl http://numbersapi.com/random/trivia
```
29 is the number of days it takes Saturn to orbit the Sun.

Curl commands can get much more complicated than this. There are tons of
options for controlling headers, cookies, authentication, and more. You
can read more about curl in the excellent free book [Everything curl](https://ec.haxx.se/).

[**Tree**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/tree.htm)

Tree is a tiny command line utility that shows you a visual
representation of the files in a directory. It works recursively, going
over each level of nesting and drawing a formated tree of all the
contents. This way you can quickly glance over and find the files you
are looking for.
```
tree
.
├── css
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
├── fonts
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff
│   └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2
└── js
├── bootstrap.js
└── bootstrap.min.js
```
There is also the option to filter the results using a simple regEx-like
pattern:
```
tree -P '*.min.*'
.
├── css
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
├── fonts
└── js
└── bootstrap.min.js
```

[**Tmux**](https://tmux.github.io/)

According to its Wiki, Tmux is a *terminal multiplexer*, which
translated in human language would mean that it\'s a tool for connecting
multiple terminals to a single terminal session.

![](./images/image001.jpeg)
A Tmux Terminal With 3 Split Screens

It lets you switch between programs in one terminal, add split screen
panes, and attach multiple terminals to the same session, keeping them
in sync. Tmux is especially useful when working on a remote server, as
it lets you create new tabs without having to log in again.

[**Disk usage - du**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/udu.htm)

The du command generates reports on the space usage of files and
directories. It is very easy to use and can work recursively, going
through each subdirectory and returning the individual size of every
file.

A common use case for du is when one of your drives is running out of
space and you don\'t know why. Using this command you can quickly see
how much storage each folder is taking, thus finding the biggest memory
hoarder.
```
# Running this will show the space usage of each folder in the current directory.
# The -h option makes the report easier to read.
# -s prevents recursiveness and shows the total size of a folder.
# The star wildcard (*) will run du on each file/folder in current directory.

du -sh *
1.2G Desktop
4.0K Documents
40G Downloads
4.0K Music
4.9M Pictures
844K Public
4.0K Templates
6.9M Videos
```
There is also a similar command called [df](Disk Free)
which returns various information about the available disk space (the
opposite of du).

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is by far the most popular version control system right now. It is
one of the defining tools of modern web dev and we just couldn\'t leave
it out of our list.

There are plenty of third-party apps and tools available but most people
prefer to access git natively though the terminal. The git CLI is really
powerful and can handle even the most tangled project history.

If you want to learn more about git, we recommend checking out our
tutorial [Learn Git in 30 Minutes](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/learn-git-in-30-minutes).

[**Tar**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/utar.htm)

Tar is the default Unix tool for working with file archives. It allows
you to quickly bundle multiple files into one package, making it easier
to store and move them later on.
```
tar -cf archive.tar file1 file2 file3
```
Using the -x option it can also extract existing .tar archives.
```
tar -xf archive.tar
```
Note that most other formats such as .zip and .rar cannot be opened
by tar and require other command utilities such
as [unzip](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/unzip.htm).

Many modern Unix systems run an expanded version of tar (GNU tar) that
can also perform file size compression:
```
# Create compressed gzip archive.
tar -czf file.tar.gz inputfile1 inputfile2
# Extract .gz archive.
tar -xzf file.tar.gz
```
If your OS doesn\'t have that version of tar, you can
use [gzip], [zcat] or [compress](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucompres.htm) to
reduce the size of file archives.

[**md5sum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum)

Unix has several built in hashing commands
including [md5sum](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/md5sum.htm), [sha1sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum) and
others. These command line tools have various applications in
programming, but most importantly they can be used for checking the
integrity of files.

For example, if you have downloaded an .iso file from an untrusted
source, there is some chance that the file contains harmful scripts. To
make sure the .iso is safe, you can generate an md5 or other hash from
it.
```
md5sum ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
0d9fe8e1ea408a5895cbbe3431989295 ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
```
You can then compare the generated string to the one provided from the
original author (e.g. [UbuntuHashes]).

[**Htop**](http://hisham.hm/htop/)

Htop is a more powerful alternative to the built-in top task manager. It
provides an advanced interface with many options for monitoring and
controlling system processes.

![](.images/image002.jpeg) 
The htop task manager in action.

Although it runs in the terminal, htop has very good support for mouse
controls. This makes it much easier to navigate the menus, select
processes, and organize the tasks thought sorting and filtering.

[**Ln**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uln.htm)

Links in Unix are similar to shortcuts in Windows, allowing you to get
quick access to certain files. Links are created via the ln command and
can be two types: hard or symbolic. Each kind has different properties
and is used for different things ([read more]](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uln.htm)).

Here is an example of one of the many ways you can use links. Let\'s say
we have a directory on our desktop called *Scripts*. It contains neatly
organized bash scripts that we commonly use. Each time we want to call
one of our scripts we would have to do this:
```
~/Desktop/Scripts/git-scripts/git-cleanup
```
Obviously, this is isn\'t very convinient as we have to write the
absolute path every time. Instead we can create a symlink from
our *Scripts* folder to */usr/local/bin*, which will make the scripts
executable from all directories.
```
sudo ln -s \~/Desktop/Scripts/git-scripts/git-cleanup /usr/local/bin/
```
With the created symlink we can now call our script by simply writing
its name in any opened terminal.
```
git-cleanup
```
[**SSH**](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command/)

With the ssh command users can quickly connect to a remote host and log
into its Unix shell. This makes it possible to conveniently issue
commands on the server directly from your local machine\'s terminal.

To establish a connection you simply need to specify the correct ip
address or url. The first time you connect to a new server there will be
some form of authentication.
```
ssh username@remote_host
```
If you want to quickly execute a command on the server without logging
in, you can simply add a command after the url. The command will run on
the server and the result from it will be returned.
```
ssh username@remote_host ls /var/www
```
some-website.com
some-other-website.com

There is a lot you can do with SSH like creating proxies and tunnels,
securing your connection with private keys, transferring files and more.
You can read more in [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys).

[**Grep**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ugrep.htm)

Grep is the standard Unix utility for finding strings inside text. It
takes an input in the form of a file or direct stream, runs its content
through a regular expression, and returns all the matching lines.

This command comes in handy when working with large files that need to
be filtered. Below we use grep in combination with the date command to
search through a large log file and generate a new file containing only
errors from today.

// Search for today's date (in format yyyy-mm-dd) and write the results to a new file.
```
grep "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")" all-errors-ever.log > today-errors.log
```
Another great command for working with strings
is [sed](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/used.htm). It
is more powerful (and more complicated) than grep and can perform almost
any string-related task including adding, removing or replacing strings.

[**Alias**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ualias.htm)

Many Unix commands, including some featured in this article, tend to get
pretty long after you add all the options to them. To make them easier
to remember, you can create short aliases with the *alias* bash built-in
command:
```
# Create an alias for starting a local web server.
alias server="python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000"

# Instead of typing the whole command simply use the alias.
server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 9000 ...
```

The alias will be available as long as you keep that terminal open. To
make it permanent you can add the alias command to your .bashrc file.
